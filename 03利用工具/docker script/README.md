# Local PentestLab Management Script

Bash script to manage web apps using docker and hosts aliases.  
Made for Kali linux, but should work fine with pretty much any linux distro.

### Current available webapps

* bWAPP
* WebGoat 7.1
* WebGoat 8.0
* Damn Vulnerable Web App
* Mutillidae II
* OWASP Juice Shop
* WPScan Vulnerable Wordpress
* OpenDNS Security Ninjas
* Altoro Mutual

### Get started 

Using any of these apps can be done in 3 quick and simple steps.

#### 1) Clone the repo
Clone this repo, or download it any way you prefer
```
git clone https://github.com/eystsen/pentestlab.git
cd pentestlab
```

#### 2) Install docker
For Kali x64 you can use this script (included in the repo).
```
./install_docker_kali_x64.sh
```
For any other distro, use the prefered way to install docker.

#### 3) Start an app
Now you can start and stop one or more of these apps on your system.
As an example, to start bWAPP just run this command
```
./pentestlab.sh start bwapp
```
This will download the docker, add bwapp to hosts file and run the docker
mapped to one of the localhost IPs.
That means you can just point your browser to http://bwapp and it will be up
and running.

#### Print a complete list of available projects use the list command
```
./pentestlab.sh list 
```

#### Running just the script will print help info
```
./pentestlabs.sh 
```
